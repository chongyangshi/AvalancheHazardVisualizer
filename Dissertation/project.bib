	Abstract = {Abstract Nearest neighbors (NN) method is very popular among avalanche forecaster world-over for data exploration and forecast guidance. The \{NN\} method based models employ snow-meteorological variables as input to search for past days with similar conditions and then analyze the events associated with past similar days to generate forecast. In order to achieve high forecast accuracy, a \{NN\} model needs to be calibrated by way of assigning distinct weights to various input variables. Thus model calibration may be treated as an optimization problem with objective to maximize the forecast accuracy. To investigate the structural characteristics of the problem, uniform random sampling method was applied on eNN10 (a \{NN\} model developed in India for avalanche forecasting). The problem has an issue of multiple optima. Population based metaheristics are suggested to handle such optimization problem better in comparison to classical analytical methods. Thus artificial bee colony algorithm, a metaheuristic inspired by the foraging behavior of honey bees, was explored to calibrate eNN10. The study was conducted for two climatologically diverse avalanche prone regions of Indian Himalaya. The results have been verified for operational forecast with significant gains in forecast accuracy in terms of Heidke skill score. },

	Abstract = {Snow avalanches are a major threat in many parts of the Alps, where they periodically damage infrastructure, disrupt transportation corridors or even cause loss of life. Nonetheless, the spatial behavior of past avalanche activity and the analysis of areas affected during particular events remain often imprecise. It was therefore the purpose of this study to reconstruct spatio-temporal patterns of past avalanche activity on a forested avalanche talus in the French Alps (Pierres Jean Jeanne talus, Massif de l'Oisans, France). A total of 232 European larches (Larix decidua Mill.) with clear signs of snow wasting events was analyzed and growth disturbances (GD) related to avalanche activity was assessed, such as tangential rows of traumatic resin ducts, the onset of compression wood or abrupt growth suppression and release. In total, 901 \{GD\} were identified in the tree-ring samples, indicating that 20 high-magnitude avalanches occurred between \{AD\} 1919 and 1994. The mean return period of snow avalanches was ~ 4 years with a ~ 26% probability that an avalanche occurs in any particular year. Interpolated maps allowed for explicit spatial estimates of return periods throughout the talus, showing a rapid increase of return frequency from 2.5 to 50 years with increasing distance from the talus apex. The distribution of avalanche years seems to be quite homogeneous in time with a gap between 1951 and 1959 and since 1994. Snowfall from a nearby meteorological station (Saint-Christophe en Oisans; 10 km from the study site) indicated that the five most recent high-magnitude events on record occurred due to above-average snowfall anomalies in December and January associated with abnormally low air temperatures. Findings suggest that a strong snow metamorphism under high temperature gradients in January could explain the occurrence of high-magnitude snow avalanches. },

@article{Lehning2001253,
	Abstract = {With the increasing use of numerical models predicting the snow cover status, the need for a simple and standardized evaluation procedure arises. We present such a method that compares numerical model profiles with snow pit profiles and provides a quantitative statistical agreement--disagreement measure. The method can also be used to compare several model profiles with each other. The first step of the method is the mapping of the model profile layers onto the layers of the observed profile. This mapping is necessary to adjust for deviating total snow depth and shifted positions of the layers. Following the mapping, the individual profile parameters such as grain type, grain size, liquid water content, temperature and density are compared. The result of the comparison is a score between 0 (profiles show no agreement) and 1 (profiles are identical) for each parameter. The parameter scores can be combined to give an overall profile score between 0 and 1. The method facilitates evaluation studies and allows to quantify improvements made in the modeling of processes in the snow cover. This is illustrated by analyzing a simulated profile at an \{IMIS\} (German: Interkantonales Mess-und Informations System) automatic snow and weather station with an observed, detailed snow pit profiles from the Swiss Alps. The agreement score for the parameter grain type increased from 0.3 to 0.7 after introducing an additional grain type in the simulation. In addition, the scores were calculated for two observation stations in the Swiss Alps for a whole winter season and it was detected that for most of the winter an overall agreement score between \{SNOWPACK\} simulation and snow pit profile of approximately 0.8 is reached. The temperature regime is modeled best and most difficulties are encountered with grain type. An important result is further that the energy balance processes at the beginning of the spring melt season has to be improved. },

	Abstract = {To describe the demographic characteristics and patterns of death of persons killed in snow avalanches over a 45-year study period. The national avalanche database was the source of data in this retrospective, descriptive study. A total of 440 victims were killed in 324 fatal avalanches, of which 87.7% were fully buried, 4.7% were partially buried, and 7.6% were not buried. The average age was 27.6$\pm$10.6 years, and 87.3% were men. Victims who died included climbers (25.5%), backcountry skiers (22.7%), out-of-bounds skiers (10.0%), snowmobilers (6.8%), in-bounds skiers (5.2%), residents (4.5%), ski patrollers (3.6%), workers (3.6%), and motorists (3.0%). Over the 45-year study period there appear to be decreases in the deaths of in-bounds skiers, highway workers, and motorists. Increasing fatalities were observed among out-of-bounds skiers, snowmobilers, ski patrollers, and backcountry skiers. Most deaths occurred in Colorado (33.0%), Washington (13.2%), and Alaska (12.0%). Avalanche fatalities have increased over the last 45 years. Climbers, backcountry skiers, out-of-bounds skiers, and more recently snowmobilers constitute the majority of the victims. The decrease in deaths among groups that benefit from avalanche control programs supports the benefit of avalanche prevention strategies. Further study is needed to assess the impact of avalanche safety education for individuals who travel in remote and uncontrolled terrain.},

@article{WARD1984109,
	Abstract = {The paper presents a method for predicting avalanche activity from meteorological data which is suitable for Scottish snow conditions. Two main types of avalanche are distinguished. Direct-action avalanches are the result of fresh snow accumulation and may release after approximately 200 mm of fresh snow has fallen over a period of a few days. They become extremely likely if a further 100 mm falls in a single day. Climax avalanches are the result of strength loss in the snow cover, due either to thawing or persistent cold. Thaws may produce an avalanche after only three or four days with maximum temperatures around 2$\,^{\circ}$C. Alternatively, if maximum temperatures remain below −4$\,^{\circ}$C for over a week, and especially if cold weather persists for two weeks, slab avalanches of dry snow are likely to occur. Between these two types are several possible avalanche situations in which fresh snow accumulation is combined with high or low temperatures. Topography plays a passive role, and determines where avalanche activity is most likely. Free faces, smooth surfaces and slopes in the lee of major storms respond most rapidly to the onset of avalanche conditions.},

	Abstract = {Quantitative risk assessment is recognised to be a sound basis for land use planning in avalanche prone areas. An important feature of an effective risk calculation procedure is its adaptability to territory changes, particularly the construction of defence works, both in the release zone and in the run-out area. In fact, the calculation of residual risk after the realisation of defence works and the possibility to compare different protection solutions in terms of risk reduction, give a substantial help in decision making processes. We present an avalanche risk estimation procedure that combines statistical analysis of snowfall record, iterative simulations of avalanche dynamics and empirically-based vulnerability relations. Our methods provides a risk estimate flexible to boundary and initial condition changes. We discuss in detail the theoretical background of the proposed method and apply it to a real case study, using a 1D dynamical simulation model and a \{GIS\} interface to visualise risk levels in the 2D run-out zone. An analysis of different protective countermeasures in a ``cost--benefit'' framework is provided as well. },

In some mountainous regions, especially in the European Alps, technical avalanche defence structures are built to increase the level of safety for inhabited areas; however, new infrastructure such as roads, railway lines and tourist facilities cause new risk potential in hazardous areas. As a result, the demand is increasing for technical avalanche protection solutions. Avalanche defence structures and protection systems are used in most inhabited mountain regions worldwide. During the last decades, technical avalanche protection has evolved from a specialist field to an independent engineering branch that has gained importance in alpine countries such as Austria, Italy, France and Switzerland, as well as in other countries such as Canada, Iceland, No},
