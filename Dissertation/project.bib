	Abstract = {This paper describes a nearest neighbours model used operationally for avalanche forecasting in Scotland. Results are presented as contingency tables and in terms of a range of categorical statistics suggesting that the model performs well in comparison with other models, although avalanche events are overforecast. Genetic algorithms are described as a technique for calculating variable weights and shown to provide an effective mechanism for objectively calculating weights. The model is discussed in the context of conventional avalanche forecasting, and it is proposed that the range of visualisations provided to the user can facilitate hypothesis testing. },

@article{WARD1984109,
	Abstract = {The paper presents a method for predicting avalanche activity from meteorological data which is suitable for Scottish snow conditions. Two main types of avalanche are distinguished. Direct-action avalanches are the result of fresh snow accumulation and may release after approximately 200 mm of fresh snow has fallen over a period of a few days. They become extremely likely if a further 100 mm falls in a single day. Climax avalanches are the result of strength loss in the snow cover, due either to thawing or persistent cold. Thaws may produce an avalanche after only three or four days with maximum temperatures around 2$\,^{\circ}$C. Alternatively, if maximum temperatures remain below âˆ’4$\,^{\circ}$C for over a week, and especially if cold weather persists for two weeks, slab avalanches of dry snow are likely to occur. Between these two types are several possible avalanche situations in which fresh snow accumulation is combined with high or low temperatures. Topography plays a passive role, and determines where avalanche activity is most likely. Free faces, smooth surfaces and slopes in the lee of major storms respond most rapidly to the onset of avalanche conditions.},

	Abstract = {Although the problem of determining the minimum cost path through a graph arises naturally in a number of interesting applications, there has been no underlying theory to guide the development of efficient search procedures. Moreover, there is no adequate conceptual framework within which the various ad hoc search strategies proposed to date can be compared. This paper describes how heuristic information from the problem domain can be incorporated into a formal mathematical theory of graph searching and demonstrates an optimality property of a class of search strategies.},

@article{Cappabianca2008193,
	Abstract = {Quantitative risk assessment is recognised to be a sound basis for land use planning in avalanche prone areas. An important feature of an effective risk calculation procedure is its adaptability to territory changes, particularly the construction of defence works, both in the release zone and in the run-out area. In fact, the calculation of residual risk after the realisation of defence works and the possibility to compare different protection solutions in terms of risk reduction, give a substantial help in decision making processes. We present an avalanche risk estimation procedure that combines statistical analysis of snowfall record, iterative simulations of avalanche dynamics and empirically-based vulnerability relations. Our methods provides a risk estimate flexible to boundary and initial condition changes. We discuss in detail the theoretical background of the proposed method and apply it to a real case study, using a 1D dynamical simulation model and a \{GIS\} interface to visualise risk levels in the 2D run-out zone. An analysis of different protective countermeasures in a ``cost--benefit'' framework is provided as well. },

	Abstract = {Snow avalanches can have highly destructive consequences in developed areas. Each year, avalanche catastrophes occur in mountain regions around the globe and cause unnecessary fatalities and severe damage to buildings and infrastructure. In some mountainous regions, especially in the European Alps, technical avalanche defence structures are built to increase the level of safety for inhabited areas; however, new infrastructure such as roads, railway lines and tourist facilities cause new risk potential in hazardous areas. As a result, the demand is increasing for technical avalanche protection solutions. Avalanche defence structures and protection systems are used in most inhabited mountain regions worldwide. During the last decades, technical avalanche protection has evolved from a specialist field to an independent engineering branch that has gained importance in alpine countries such as Austria, Italy, France and Switzerland, as well as in other countries such as Canada, Iceland, No},
